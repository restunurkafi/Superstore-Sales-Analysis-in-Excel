📝 Data Cleaning Process
Before building the dashboard, I performed extensive data cleaning in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Key Steps:  
✅ **Split combined fields** into separate columns using *Text to Columns*.  
✅ **Convert range to Table (Ctrl+T)** for structured formatting and readability.  
✅ **Remove duplicates** and handle missing values using *Ctrl+G → Special → Blanks*.  
✅ **Standardize text entries** (remove extra spaces) with **Power Query**.  
✅ **Unify inconsistent date formats** into a single standardized format.  

🗂️ **Final Outcome:**  
A clean, structured, and standardized dataset ready for further analysis and dashboarding.
